# VisionProj

This is an ever evolving project as I learn more about Machine Learning.

Current Goals:

    Make it modular. All run on Pi's or pi zeros so needs to be fucking fast and effecient. Each module will have its own requirements. Try to put as much work on modules rather than hub (linux box with control software? Ras Pi? Cloud Hosted?)

    Smart Locking system (Have demo on pi for motor control, need hardware. 3D Print?)
        Face Detection
        Gesture Recogniion
        Machine Learning
        Motor Control
        Cad

    Track items or people/creatures:
        Object Detection for keys, wallet, cat, people (face detect as well?)
        Yolo Modeling for detection
        Machine Learn

    Very Basic NLP
        Tell to lock up. Locks all locks (seperate board project)
        Control smart lights?
        Play music. Launch spotify and play to speakers on wifi

    ML
        Try to create a system for "learning on fly".
            If feedback on state with high probability found save everythings state to xml. Train a model during off hours and reload. (Midnight? Lights out and in bed? Request?)
