For training new pieces:
    Get new piece images:
        Download and setup ldcad
        replace samples.lua with this one for LDCAD
        generate a parts list for a lego set and open the ldr file with ldcad
        In LDCAD:
            Session -> Animation ->OpenGL
            background = #FFFFFF
            image size 300x300
    
    Create new Model:
        Label all images:
            Use a image labeling software such as labelimg to add tags to all images (will take a while)
        Train model
